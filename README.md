# CodeProject

Testing the code - run the RouteTest.java file for some quick unit tests. The output from the tests is printed in the console.
I created a Maven project with the NetBeans IDE, which handled downloading the dependencies.
Otherwise, you can run the program and test it with your own input. Just make sure the route, stop, and direction inputs are valid. 
I assumed the user would know where they are, the route they are taking, and the direction they want to go, and didn't defend against invalid data.

Running - I tried to run via the command line with arguments, but couldn't figure out how to run a Maven project. All my manual test runs were done running
thru NetBeans and using the provided console. Theoretically it should work with Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc. Again, make sure the route is valid, the stop is valid for the route, and the 
direction is valid for the route.
